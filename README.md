# ParkourRunner
A plugin to create parkour maps with timers, checkpoints, leaderboards ect.
Not sure if this will work as expected. Have tested before and it worked, but there is still a lot of work needed. I'm not sure if I will ever finish this.
The plugin isn't very well coded--meaning the performance isn't very good and I'm not a very experienced programmer.
